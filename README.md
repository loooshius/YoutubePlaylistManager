# YouTube Playlist Manager

Development (June 2021 - Present)

Status: _In-Progress_

Intended to streamline and automate organizing / scrubbing YouTube playlists. The Youtube UI makes handling large playlists very difficult, so this application is intended to accelerate the cleaning / tidying process. Inspiration came from watching my sibling spend hours scrubbing their massive YouTube playlists.

This project is still very roughly in development, but I hope to dedicate more time to it when more free time opens up. My initial plan is to host it online. Alternative goal / stretch goal is to make it into an Electron web application.

Super stretch goal is to create a mobile app using React Native.
